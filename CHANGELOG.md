# Changelog

Every build that ships gets an entry here, newest first. Entries say what
changed for someone running the integration, and name the decision record
(`docs/decisions/`) where one applies.

Headings used: **Fixed**, **Changed**, **Added**, **Removed**.

## 0.8.13 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- **Precool is no longer throttled by power management.** A room set to
  enforced that was precooling during a no-import window was held to the
  power ceiling. Precool runs in a window chosen because energy is free, so it
  is now exempt, and the room's trace says "power budget: precool is not
  rationed". (DR-037)
- **Grid import during a no-import window was overstated.** Each evaluation
  added a fixed 30 seconds of import, but evaluations also run whenever a
  watched sensor changes, so the same half-minute was counted several times
  over. Import is now weighted by the time since the previous reading, and a
  gap longer than 30 seconds counts as 30 seconds. (DR-043)
- **A no-import window was judged every half hour instead of as a whole.**
  The tariff arrives in 30-minute slices and each slice was treated as its own
  window, so the warning compared each half hour against the 0.05 kWh floor
  and reported only the last one. A window now runs from the first slice
  carrying the constraint to the last. (DR-043)
- **The shortfall warning never cleared.** It now clears when a later
  no-import window closes without importing. (DR-043)

### Changed

- **Shortfall warning text** now describes the three power management
  settings (off, guidance, enforced) and says when the warning clears.
  (DR-041, DR-043)

### Added

- **Decision records** in `docs/decisions/`: 47 records of the decisions behind
  the integration, with the options that lost, where each lives in the code,
  and whether this build matches it. `check_anchors.py` checks the code
  references.
- **This changelog.**
- Tests: precool exemption, and four for grid import measurement.

### Removed

- **The retired power refusal.** The code that could stop the compressor for
  a power reason had been unreachable since 0.8.10. The field and both
  branches are gone, along with the five tests that exercised them. (DR-036)
